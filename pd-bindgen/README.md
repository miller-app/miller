# pd-bindgen

Raw bindings for Pure Data, generated by bindgen.




## Build

Depends on Msys2 on Windows.

`wrapper.h` is generated with script `generate_wrapper.sh`. The script also
downloads Pure Data at specific tag (should be passed as the first argument for
the script, for example `generate_wrapper.sh 0.51-4`). The script should be ran
only when you need to update Pure Data sources to a new version/tag.

# libpd-sys

Raw bindings for [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd), generated by bindgen.




## Build

Depends on Msys2 on Windows.

`wrapper.h` is generated with script `generate_wrapper.sh`. The script also
downloads **libpd** at specific tag (should be passed as the first argument for
the script, for example `generate_wrapper.sh 0.12.1`). The script should be ran
only when you need to update **libpd** sources to a new version/tag.
